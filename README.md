# Active-SLAM-Based-on-Information-Theory
Information Theoretic Exploration with GP and BO

## Overview
Here is a simulation of infomation-theoretic exploration with python. ROS-based method is released by **Robust Field Autonomy Lab**. To make the principle and mechanism more clear for active slamer, I reproduce it with python and revise some functions.
